It indicates an ES6 module file.

Node.js's original module system is CommonJs 
(which uses require and module.exports).

Since Node.js was created, the ECMAScript module system 
(which uses import and export) has become standard and Node.js 
has added support for it.

Node.js will treat .cjs files as CommonJS modules and .mjs 
files as ECMAScript modules. It will treat .js files as whatever 
the default module system for the project is (which is CommonJS 
unless package.json says "type": "module",).

As a POST request, the parameters arrive 
in the body of the request rather than as URL parameters.
Because of the mapParams flag on the bodyParams handler, 
the arguments passed in the HTTP body are added to req.params.
